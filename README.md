TODOS:

- Fix horizontal line bug, maybe by removing entirely
- Match highlight point hovertext to line hovertext, or remove entirely 
- Add US historical brackets from [taxfoundation.org](https://taxfoundation.org/historical-income-tax-rates-brackets/)
- Adjust historical brackets with CPI, maybe from [SSA](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/avgcpi.html)
